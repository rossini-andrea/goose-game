# The Goose Game

This game was produced as an entry to the contest **The Goose Game Kata** by [Matteo Vaccari](https://github.com/xpmatteo).

## How to install

Clone this project or download `goose-game.py`.

Additional requirements:

* Python 3

## How to run

Enter the directory where you downloaded `goose-game.py` and run it.

### On Linux

At the command line, type:

```sh
cd goose-game
./goose-game.py
```

Alternatively, run the explicit python interpreter:

```sh
cd goose-game
python goose-game.py
```

### On Windows

```bat
cd goose-game
python goose-game.py
```

Alternatively, the standard Python installer already associates the .py extension with a file type (Python.File) and gives that file type an open command that runs the interpreter (`C:\Program Files\Python\python.exe "%1" %*`). This is enough to make scripts executable from the command prompt as `goose-game.py`. If you'd rather be able to execute the script by simple typing `goose-game` with no extension you need to add .py to the `PATHEXT` environment variable.
